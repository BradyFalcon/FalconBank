Getting Started:
First open up your cmd line. 
Then choose a folder you want to store the file into. Type in cd "filename"
Install nodejs, to do this on Linux system type in sudo apt install nodejs.
If you are using windows you have to go to the website https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Then type in git clone https://github.com/BradyFalcon/FalconBank.git.

After cloning repository, I used Visual Studio to run my frontend service.
To do this, open up the folder you have the application saved into, after opening the terminal inside Visual studio you have to change directory. Use the command in
the visual studio terminal: cd front-end service/src.
When you are in the src folder in the terminal use the command npm install. This will install all the files you need to run the frontend.

To run the backend I used the IntelliJ IDE, to use this IDE all you have to do is download it. Open the folder that contains the application. Then, you want to rebuild
the application. After the application is built, you want to press Run. If done correctly the backend should be up and running. Also, if you don't know how to set up
tables in MySql I have included the command to AutoCreate your database and the tables. All you have to do is uncomment it, and then run the program.



Usage:
To view the application up and running, just go to your web browser and type in LocalHost:3000. This will take you to the webpage outlook.
